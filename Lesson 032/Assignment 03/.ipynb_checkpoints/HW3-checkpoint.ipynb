    "\n",
    "(a) Machine learning (ML) is a technique to solve optimization problems based on self-adaptive algorithms,\n",
    "by learning from known examples (supervised paradigm) or by self-organizing data (unsupervised paradigm).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Data Mining (DM) is the exploration of data searching for unknown properties\n",
    "and correlation laws (that's why data mining is a synonymous of Knowledge Discovery in Databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Data Mining is the more general concept. Different families of techniques can be applied to data\n",
    "to \"mine\" it. Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, ...) is one family of data analysis techniques.\n",
    "Traditional statistics (regression analysis, principal components, factorial analysis, etc.) is another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DM could make use of ML. In particular clustering problems, based on the unsupervised ML paradigm,\n",
    "are a typical case of DM, since you train a machine to search unpredictable overdensities of\n",
    "data entries in the parameter space, without any a priori assumption.\n"
